# Provider Access Control Fix

## Issue Description
When a patient revoked a provider's access and the provider sent a renewed request, the provider could see full patient details even though the status showed "Full Access Pending". This was a security issue where providers should only see patient data when they have been approved.

## Root Cause
The system was checking if ANY connection existed between provider and patient, without verifying the actual access level and approval status. This allowed providers with pending requests to see full patient data.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes

#### Provider Controller (`server/controllers/providerController.js`)
- Updated `getPatientById` to return limited data when `fullAccessStatus` is not 'approved'
- Only returns basic info (firstName, lastName, email, _id) for providers with:
  - Limited access
  - Pending full access requests
  - Denied full access requests

#### Auth Middleware (`server/middleware/auth.middleware.js`)
- Updated `canProviderAccessPatient` to accept a `requireFullAccess` parameter
- Now properly checks if full access is approved when required
- Returns false if provider doesn't have the required access level

#### Consultation Controller (`server/controllers/consultation.controller.js`)
- Updated `getAllConsultations` to check provider access level when filtering by patient
- Providers with limited/pending access only see consultations they created
- Providers with approved full access can see all patient consultations

#### Medical Records Controller (`server/controllers/medicalRecord.controller.js`)
- Updated `getMedicalRecordsByType` to check provider access level
- Limited/pending access providers only see records they created
- Full approved access providers can see all patient records

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### ViewPatient Component (`client/src/pages/provider/ViewPatient.jsx`)
- Updated to check `connectionInfo` from the API response
- Only displays full patient data when:
  - `accessLevel === 'full'`
  - `fullAccessStatus === 'approved'`
- Shows limited access message with only basic info for pending/limited access
- Displays appropriate UI based on access level

## Access Level Rules

### Limited Access (Default)
- Providers can only view consultations and medical records THEY created
- NO access to patient profile data
- NO access to records from other providers
- Automatically granted when connection is created

### Full Access Pending
- Same as limited access
- Provider has requested full access but patient hasn't approved yet
- Shows "Full Access Pending" status in UI

### Full Access Approved
- Can view ALL patient data including profile, all consultations, all medical records
- Requires explicit patient approval
- Patient can revoke at any time

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
cd server/tests
node test-revoked-access.js
```

## Security Best Practices
1. Always check both `accessLevel` and `fullAccessStatus` when determining access
2. Default to limited access when in doubt
3. Never expose sensitive patient data without explicit approval
4. Log all access attempts for audit purposes
