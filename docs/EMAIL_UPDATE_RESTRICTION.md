# Email Update Restriction

## Overview

As of this update, email addresses cannot be changed by users after account creation. This applies to all user types: admin, patient, and provider.

## Why This Restriction?

1. **Security**: Email is used as the primary identifier for authentication
2. **Data Integrity**: Prevents duplicate accounts and maintains connection integrity
3. **Audit Trail**: Ensures accountability and traceability of user actions
4. **Password Reset**: Email is critical for account recovery mechanisms

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

1. **User Controller** (`server/controllers/user.controller.js`)
   - Added `delete updateData.email` to prevent email updates via profile endpoint

2. **Admin Controller** (`server/controllers/admin.controller.js`)
   - Removed email from updateProfile function parameters
   - Removed email update logic

3. **Provider Controller** (`server/controllers/providerController.js`)
   - Added `delete updateData.email` to prevent email updates

### Frontend Changes

1. **Admin Settings** (`client/src/pages/admin/Settings.jsx`)
   - Email input field made read-only and disabled
   - Added helper text explaining the restriction
   - Removed email from profile update requests

2. **Patient Settings** (`client/src/pages/patient/Settings.jsx`)
   - Email input field made read-only and disabled
   - Added helper text explaining the restriction
   - Removed email from profile update requests

3. **Provider Settings** (`client/src/pages/provider/Settings.jsx`)
   - Email already displayed as read-only text (no change needed)

### Styling

Added CSS for disabled inputs and field hints in:
- `client/src/pages/admin/Settings.module.css`
- `client/src/pages/patient/Settings.module.css`

## Future Considerations

If email changes are needed in the future, consider:
1. Implementing a verification process (send confirmation to both old and new email)
2. Admin-only email change functionality with audit logging
3. Temporary tokens for email migration
4. Grace period before the change takes effect

## Testing

Ensure that:
1. Email fields appear disabled on all settings pages
2. Backend rejects any attempts to update email
3. Other profile fields can still be updated successfully
4. No errors occur when saving profile without email
