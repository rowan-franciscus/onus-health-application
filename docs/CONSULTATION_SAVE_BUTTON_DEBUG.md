# Consultation Save Button Debug

## Issue
The "Save Consultation" button in the provider's consultation form doesn't trigger any action when clicked, with no errors showing in the browser console. This happens when trying to save a draft consultation as completed.

## Debug Steps Added

### 1. Form Submission Logging
Added console logs to track the form submission flow:
- When Formik's onSubmit is triggered
- Form values and attachments being submitted
- Any errors during submission

### 2. Validation Debugging
Added a custom validate function to Formik that:
- Logs when validation is called
- Shows any validation errors found
- Helps identify if validation is blocking submission

### 3. Manual Form Submission
Changed the "Save Consultation" button from `type="submit"` to `type="button"` with a manual click handler that:
- Logs when the button is clicked
- Manually calls `formik.handleSubmit()`
- Ensures the form submission is triggered

### 4. Error Handling
Enhanced error handling in the onSubmit function to:
- Catch and log any errors during submission
- Set form-level errors if submission fails
- Properly manage the submitting state

## What to Check

When testing, open the browser console and look for:

1. **"Save Consultation button clicked - manual submit"** - Confirms the button click is registered
2. **"=== FORMIK VALIDATE CALLED ==="** - Shows if validation is running
3. **"Validation errors:"** - Lists any validation errors preventing submission
4. **"=== FORMIK ONSUBMIT TRIGGERED ==="** - Confirms the form submission is triggered
5. **"handleSubmit called with formData:"** - Shows the submission reached the parent component

## Potential Issues to Investigate

1. **Validation Errors**: The validation schema might be blocking submission silently
2. **Data Structure Mismatch**: Form data structure might not match what the validation schema expects
3. **Async Issues**: The form might be submitting but failing silently in the async handler
4. **State Management**: The `isSaving` state might be stuck, preventing submission

## Next Steps

1. Test with the browser console open
2. Look for the debug messages listed above
3. Check if any validation errors are logged
4. Verify that the handleSubmit function in AddConsultation.jsx is called

The debug logs will help identify exactly where the submission process is failing.
