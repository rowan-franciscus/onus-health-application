# Consultation Draft Fix Documentation

## Issues Fixed

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve issues with consultation draft functionality.

### 1. Vitals Data Not Loading When Editing Drafts

**Problem:** When editing a draft consultation, all vitals fields were empty despite having saved data.

**Root Cause:** In `client/src/pages/provider/AddConsultation.jsx`, the `getInitialFormValues` function was initializing vitals fields with empty strings instead of populating from the saved consultation data.

**Fix:** Updated the vitals initialization to properly extract values from the nested vitals object structure:
```javascript
vitals: {
  heartRate: consultationData.vitals?.heartRate?.value || '',
  bloodPressure: {
    systolic: consultationData.vitals?.bloodPressure?.systolic || '',
    diastolic: consultationData.vitals?.bloodPressure?.diastolic || ''
  },
  bodyTemperature: consultationData.vitals?.bodyTemperature?.value || '',
  // ... other vitals fields
}
```

### 2. Medical Records Not Displaying Correctly

**Problem:** Various fields in medication, immunization, radiology, and surgery tabs were not displaying or showing "Not specified" when editing drafts.

**Root Cause:** The MongoDB models use different field names and structures than what the client components expect. For example:
- MedicationRecord uses `reasonForPrescription` but client expects `reason`
- HospitalRecord uses `treatmentsReceived` (array) but client expects `treatments` (string)
- HospitalRecord uses `attendingDoctors` (array of objects) but client expects a string

**Fix:** Added proper data transformation when loading consultation data for editing:
```javascript
medication: consultationData.medications?.map(med => ({
  name: med.name || '',
  dosage: med.dosage?.value || '',
  dosageUnit: med.dosage?.unit || '',
  frequency: med.frequency || '',
  reason: med.reasonForPrescription || '',
  startDate: med.startDate ? new Date(med.startDate).toISOString().substr(0, 10) : '',
  endDate: med.endDate ? new Date(med.endDate).toISOString().substr(0, 10) : ''
})) || [],
// Similar transformations for other medical record types
```

### 3. Hospital Tab Crash (React Error 31)

**Problem:** Clicking on the Hospital tab caused the app to crash with React error 31 (Objects are not valid as React children).

**Root Cause:** The hospital records data structure included arrays and objects (like `attendingDoctors` array with `{name, specialty}` objects) that were being rendered directly in JSX.

**Fix:** Transformed array and object fields to strings when loading data:
```javascript
hospital: consultationData.hospitalRecords?.map(hosp => ({
  // ... other fields
  attendingDoctors: Array.isArray(hosp.attendingDoctors) ? 
    hosp.attendingDoctors.map(doc => doc.name || doc).join(', ') : 
    hosp.attendingDoctors || '',
  // ... other fields
})) || [],
```

### 4. File Attachments

**Analysis:** The file attachment logic appears to be correctly implemented:
- Files are uploaded after consultation is saved using `FileService.uploadConsultationFile`
- Existing attachments are properly separated from new files in the ConsultationForm component
- The backend correctly stores and retrieves attachments

**Note:** If attachments still don't appear when editing drafts, ensure the consultation is being fetched with populated attachments.

## Testing Instructions

To verify these fixes work correctly:

1. **Create a New Draft Consultation:**
   - Sign in as a provider
   - Create a new consultation for a patient
   - Fill in all tabs with test data:
     - General information
     - Vitals (all fields)
     - Add at least one medication with all fields
     - Add at least one immunization
     - Add at least one radiology report
     - Add at least one hospital record
     - Add at least one surgery record
   - Upload a test file attachment
   - Click "Save Draft"

2. **Edit the Draft Consultation:**
   - Navigate to consultations list
   - Find the draft consultation and click to edit
   - Verify all data is correctly populated:
     - ✓ Vitals tab shows all previously entered values
     - ✓ Medications tab shows correct data including reason field
     - ✓ Immunizations tab shows vaccine name and serial number
     - ✓ Radiology tab shows scan type and body part examined
     - ✓ Hospital tab opens without crashing and shows all data
     - ✓ Surgery tab shows surgery type
     - ✓ Existing attachments are displayed

3. **Save Changes:**
   - Make some modifications to the data
   - Save as draft again
   - Re-open to verify changes persisted

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- `client/src/pages/provider/AddConsultation.jsx` - Fixed data initialization and transformation

### MongoDB Model Field Mappings:
- `MedicationRecord.reasonForPrescription` → `reason` (client)
- `ImmunizationRecord.vaccineName` → `vaccineName` (client)
- `ImmunizationRecord.vaccineSerialNumber` → `serialNumber` (client)
- `RadiologyReport.typeOfScan` → `scanType` (client)
- `RadiologyReport.bodyPartExamined` → `bodyPartExamined` (client)
- `HospitalRecord.reasonForHospitalization` → `reason` (client)
- `HospitalRecord.treatmentsReceived[]` → `treatments` (string, client)
- `HospitalRecord.attendingDoctors[{name, specialty}]` → `attendingDoctors` (string, client)
- `HospitalRecord.investigationsDone[]` → `investigations` (string, client)
- `SurgeryRecord.typeOfSurgery` → `surgeryType` (client)

## Future Considerations

1. Consider updating the client component field names to match the MongoDB models for consistency
2. Add validation to ensure required fields are populated when saving drafts
3. Consider adding auto-save functionality for drafts
4. Add visual indicators to distinguish between draft and completed consultations in the UI
