#### Provider Testing

   - During Professional Information step, upload a license file
   - Complete onboarding
   - Verify license is saved

2. **Consultation Attachments**:
   - Create a new consultation
   - In the Attachments section, upload multiple files
   - Save as draft
   - Edit the consultation and verify files are still there
   - Delete a file (only works for drafts)
   - Complete the consultation
   - Verify delete button is disabled for completed consultations

3. **View Own License**:

### API Endpoints

#### File Operations
- `GET /api/files/:type/:filename` - Download/view file
- `GET /api/files/:type/:filename/info` - Get file metadata
- `DELETE /api/files/:type/:filename` - Delete file
- `GET /api/files/consultation/:consultationId/attachments` - List consultation files

#### Upload Endpoints
- `POST /api/users/provider-onboarding` - Upload license during onboarding
- `POST /api/consultations/:id/attachments` - Upload consultation attachment
- `DELETE /api/consultations/:id/attachments/:attachmentId` - Delete consultation attachment

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"File not found" errors**:
   - Check if upload directories exist in `server/uploads/`
   - Verify file permissions on the server

2. **Authentication errors**:
   - Ensure JWT token is present in localStorage
   - Check token expiration

3. **Upload failures**:
   - Verify file size is under 5MB
   - Check file type is supported
   - Ensure proper multipart/form-data headers

### Debug Tips

1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Monitor network tab for API responses
3. Check server logs for file operation details
4. Verify file exists in server upload directory
