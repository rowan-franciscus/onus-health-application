# Email Click Tracking SSL Certificate Fix

## Issue
Users were experiencing SSL certificate errors when clicking email verification links. The error message indicated:
```
NET::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID
url1179.onus.health normally uses encryption to protect your information...
```

## Root Cause
SendGrid's click tracking feature was enabled by default, which creates intermediate tracking URLs (e.g., url1179.onus.health) that don't have valid SSL certificates. These tracking URLs are used to monitor email engagement but can cause security warnings in browsers.

## Solution
Disabled SendGrid's click tracking and open tracking features for all emails sent through the application.

### Changes Made
Modified `server/services/email.service.js` to add tracking settings when sending emails via SendGrid:

```javascript
const sendGridEmail = {
  ...email,
  trackingSettings: {
    clickTracking: {
      enable: false,
      enableText: false
    },
    openTracking: {
      enable: false
    }
  }
};
```

## Benefits
1. **No SSL Certificate Errors**: Users can click verification links without security warnings
2. **Direct Links**: Email links go directly to the application without intermediate redirects
3. **Better User Experience**: Smoother email verification process

## Impact
- All emails sent via SendGrid will no longer have click tracking
- This affects all email types: verification, password reset, notifications, etc.
- Email analytics in SendGrid dashboard will no longer show click/open rates

## Testing
After this fix, new verification emails will:
1. Contain direct links to the application (no tracking URLs)
2. Work without SSL certificate warnings
3. Redirect users properly after verification

## Note
If email analytics are needed in the future, consider:
1. Using custom analytics within the application
2. Implementing server-side tracking
3. Using a custom domain for SendGrid tracking with proper SSL certificates
