# Profile Picture Caching Fix v2

## Issue
Users reported that after updating their profile picture:
1. The old profile picture would reappear after page refresh
2. The profile picture was not displaying in the header (top right corner next to username)

## Root Causes
1. **Browser Caching**: The public profile endpoint (`/files/public/profile/:userId`) was using `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600`, causing browsers to cache profile pictures for 1 hour
2. **Stale JWT Data**: The JWT token contained old user data, and on page refresh, the app was loading user info from the JWT instead of fetching fresh data

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes

#### File: `/server/routes/file.routes.js`
- Updated cache control headers on the public profile endpoint to prevent caching:
  ```javascript
  'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate',
  'Pragma': 'no-cache',
  'Expires': '0',
  ```

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### File: `/client/src/services/file.service.js`
- Modified `getProfilePictureUrl()` to add intelligent cache busting:
  - Extracts version from filename for stable caching
  - Adds timestamp cache buster when explicitly requested
  - Added `bustCache` parameter (default: false) for forced cache refresh

#### Settings Pages (Patient, Provider, Admin)
- **Previous fix**: Fetch fresh user data from server after profile picture upload/deletion
- **New addition**: Pass `bustCache: true` to force cache refresh in ProfilePictureUpload component

#### File: `/client/src/components/layouts/DashboardLayout/DashboardLayout.jsx`
- Updated to use cache busting for profile pictures in the header

## Testing Instructions

### Test All User Types
1. **Patient Account**: `patient.test@email.com` / `password@123`
2. **Provider Account**: `provider.test@email.com` / `password@123`
3. **Admin Account**: `admin.test@email.com` / `password@123`

### Test Steps for Each User Type:
1. Sign in to the account
2. Go to Settings page
3. Upload a new profile picture
4. Verify:
   - ✅ Profile picture shows immediately in Settings page
   - ✅ Profile picture shows in header (top right corner)
   - ✅ Success toast message appears
5. Refresh the page (F5 or browser refresh)
6. Verify:
   - ✅ New profile picture persists in Settings page
   - ✅ New profile picture persists in header
7. Remove the profile picture
8. Verify:
   - ✅ Profile picture is removed from Settings page
   - ✅ Default initials placeholder shows in header
   - ✅ Success toast message appears
9. Refresh the page again
10. Verify:
    - ✅ Profile picture remains removed
    - ✅ Default initials placeholder still shows in header

### What to Look For:
- No console errors during upload/removal
- Profile pictures update immediately without needing refresh
- Profile pictures persist correctly after page refresh
- Profile pictures display correctly in both Settings page and header
- Cache busting doesn't cause excessive reloading during normal navigation

## Technical Details

### Cache Busting Strategy
- Uses filename version for stable caching (prevents unnecessary reloads)
- Falls back to timestamp when no version is available
- Explicit cache busting available via `bustCache` parameter

### Why This Works
1. **No Browser Caching**: Server now sends headers that prevent browser caching
2. **Fresh Data on Refresh**: Frontend fetches fresh user data after profile updates
3. **Cache Busting**: URLs include version/timestamp to force new image loads
4. **Redux Store Updates**: User data is properly updated in the global state

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing server-side image versioning
- Add ETag support for more efficient caching
- Implement progressive image loading for better UX
