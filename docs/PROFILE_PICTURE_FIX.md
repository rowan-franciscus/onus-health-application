# Profile Picture Caching Fix

## Issue
When users uploaded or removed their profile picture, the changes were saved correctly to the database, but after refreshing the page, the old profile picture would reappear. This was because the JWT token contained stale user data.

## Root Cause
1. The JWT token stores user information including the profile picture URL
2. When profile pictures were updated/deleted, only the Redux store was updated locally
3. On page refresh, the app loaded user data from the JWT token, which still had the old profile picture information

## Solution Implemented
Updated all Settings pages (patient, provider, admin) to fetch fresh user data from the server after profile picture changes:

### Files Modified:
1. `/client/src/pages/patient/Settings.jsx`
2. `/client/src/pages/provider/Settings.jsx`
3. `/client/src/pages/admin/Settings.jsx`

### Changes Made:
- Added `UserProfileService` and `authSuccess` imports
- Modified `handleProfilePictureUpload` to fetch fresh user data after upload
- Modified `handleProfilePictureRemove` to fetch fresh user data after deletion
- Updated Redux store with fresh user data using `authSuccess` action

## Testing Instructions

### Test on Deployed Application:
1. **Patient Account Testing:**
   - Sign in as patient: `patient.test@email.com` / `password@123`
   - Go to Settings page
   - Upload a new profile picture
   - Refresh the page - the new picture should persist
   - Remove the profile picture
   - Refresh the page - the profile picture should remain removed

2. **Provider Account Testing:**
   - Sign in as provider: `provider.test@email.com` / `password@123`
   - Repeat the same test steps as patient

3. **Admin Account Testing:**
   - Sign in as admin: `admin.test@email.com` / `password@123`
   - Repeat the same test steps as patient

### What to Verify:
- ✅ Profile picture uploads correctly and shows immediately
- ✅ Profile picture persists after page refresh
- ✅ Profile picture removal works correctly
- ✅ Removed profile picture stays removed after page refresh
- ✅ No console errors during upload/removal
- ✅ Success toast messages appear for both upload and removal

## Future Optimization
Consider implementing one of these backend optimizations:
1. Return a new JWT token with updated user data after profile changes
2. Return the complete updated user object in the upload/delete response
3. Implement a separate endpoint to refresh the JWT token with current user data

This would reduce the need for an extra API call to fetch user data after profile updates.
