# Email Verification Redirect Fix

## Issue
When users clicked on email verification links, they were being redirected to the sign-in page instead of the onboarding page after successful verification.

## Root Cause
The backend was not redirecting to the correct role-specific onboarding pages after email verification.

## Solution

### 1. Email Service Configuration
The email service uses frontend routes for verification links:
```javascript
const verificationUrl = `${config.frontendUrl}/verify-email/${token}`;
```

### 2. Updated Backend Redirect Logic
Modified `server/controllers/authController.js` to redirect users to role-specific pages after verification:
- New users → role-specific onboarding pages with auth token
- Already verified users → role-specific dashboards

### 3. Updated Onboarding Pages
Added token handling to both patient and provider onboarding pages to:
- Extract authentication token from URL parameters
- Authenticate the user automatically
- Update Redux store with user data
- Remove token from URL for security

### 4. Updated API Response
Modified the `/auth/me` endpoint to include a `success` flag in the response for consistency.

## How It Works Now

1. User signs up and receives verification email
2. Email contains link to: `https://your-app.com/verify-email/{token}`
3. React app loads and makes POST request to verify the email
4. Backend verifies email and either:
   - Returns success for POST requests (from React app)
   - Redirects to role-specific onboarding with token for GET requests (direct link clicks)
5. User can complete onboarding while authenticated

## Testing

1. Create a new patient account
2. Check email for verification link
3. Click the link - you should be redirected to patient onboarding
4. Verify you're logged in (check Redux DevTools or network requests)

5. Create a new provider account
6. Check email for verification link
7. Click the link - you should be redirected to provider onboarding
8. Verify you're logged in

## Render Configuration
The current Render rewrite rule is correct:
- Source: `/*`
- Destination: `/index.html`
- Action: Rewrite

This allows the React app to handle client-side routing while API requests go directly to the backend.
