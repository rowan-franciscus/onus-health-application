# Email Verification Redirect Fix

## Issue
When users clicked on email verification links, they were being redirected to the sign-in page instead of the onboarding page after successful verification.

## Root Cause
The verification URLs in emails were pointing to the frontend route (`/verify-email/{token}`) instead of the backend API endpoint (`/api/auth/verify/{token}`). This prevented the backend from properly handling the redirect with authentication tokens.

## Solution

### 1. Updated Email Service
Modified `server/services/email.service.js` to construct verification URLs that point to the backend API:
```javascript
const apiBaseUrl = config.frontendUrl.replace(/\/$/, '') + '/api';
const verificationUrl = `${apiBaseUrl}/auth/verify/${token}`;
```

### 2. Updated Onboarding Pages
Added token handling to both patient and provider onboarding pages to:
- Extract authentication token from URL parameters
- Authenticate the user automatically
- Update Redux store with user data
- Remove token from URL for security

### 3. Updated API Response
Modified the `/auth/me` endpoint to include a `success` flag in the response for consistency.

## How It Works Now

1. User signs up and receives verification email
2. Email contains link to: `https://your-app.com/api/auth/verify/{token}`
3. When clicked, backend verifies the email and redirects to: `/onboarding?role={role}&token={authToken}`
4. Onboarding page extracts the token, authenticates the user, and removes it from URL
5. User can complete onboarding while authenticated

## Testing

1. Create a new patient account
2. Check email for verification link
3. Click the link - you should be redirected to patient onboarding
4. Verify you're logged in (check Redux DevTools or network requests)

5. Create a new provider account
6. Check email for verification link
7. Click the link - you should be redirected to provider onboarding
8. Verify you're logged in

## Render Configuration
The current Render rewrite rule is correct:
- Source: `/*`
- Destination: `/index.html`
- Action: Rewrite

This allows the React app to handle client-side routing while API requests go directly to the backend.
