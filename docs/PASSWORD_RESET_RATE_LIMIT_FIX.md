# Password Reset Rate Limiting Fix

## Issue Description

Users were experiencing the error "Too many password reset attempts, please try again after an hour" even when they hadn't made multiple attempts. This was occurring specifically in the deployed application on Render.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by missing `trust proxy` configuration in Express. When deployed behind Render's reverse proxy:
- All requests appeared to come from the same IP address (the proxy's IP)
- The rate limiter counted all password reset attempts globally rather than per user
- After 3 attempts from ANY user, ALL users were blocked

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enable Trust Proxy (server/server.js)
```javascript
// Trust proxy - Essential for cloud deployments (Render, Heroku, etc.)
// This ensures Express correctly reads the client's real IP from X-Forwarded-For header
if (config.env === 'production') {
  app.set('trust proxy', true);
  logger.info('Trust proxy enabled for production environment');
}
```

### 2. Improve Rate Limiter (server/middleware/auth.middleware.js)
- Increased limit from 3 to 5 attempts per hour for better user experience
- Added logging when rate limit is hit for debugging
- Disabled rate limiting in development environment

## How It Works

With `trust proxy` enabled:
- Express reads the real client IP from the `X-Forwarded-For` header
- Each user's password reset attempts are tracked individually
- Rate limiting works as intended, blocking only users who exceed the limit

## Testing

After deployment, you can verify the fix by:
1. Checking server logs for "Trust proxy enabled for production environment"
2. Testing password reset from different devices/networks
3. Monitoring rate limit logs to see individual IPs being tracked

## Additional Notes

- This fix is essential for any Express app deployed behind a reverse proxy
- Common platforms requiring this: Render, Heroku, AWS ELB, Nginx
- The rate limit of 5 attempts per hour provides security while being user-friendly
