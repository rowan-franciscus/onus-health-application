# Database Cleanup Report

## Date: July 22, 2025

### Context
Users were deleted from the MongoDB Atlas database through the web interface, leaving orphaned data (connections, consultations, and medical records) that referenced non-existent users.

### Cleanup Script Used
The existing `server/scripts/cleanupOrphanedData.js` script was used to identify and remove orphaned data.

### Data Cleaned

#### Summary of Deleted Records:
- **4 orphaned connections** - Patient-provider relationships where one or both users no longer existed
- **5 orphaned consultations** - Medical consultations linked to deleted users  
- **27 orphaned medical records** - Various medical record types associated with the orphaned consultations:
  - 4 vitals records
  - 3 medications records
  - 4 immunizations records
  - 4 lab results records
  - 4 radiology reports
  - 4 hospital records
  - 4 surgery records

#### Database Statistics After Cleanup:
- Total users: 6
- Total connections: 2 (down from 6)
- Total consultations: 19 (down from 24)
- All remaining connections have valid user references
- All remaining consultations have valid user references

### Verification
The script verified data integrity after cleanup, confirming that:
1. All remaining connections have valid provider and patient references
2. All remaining consultations have valid provider and patient references
3. No orphaned medical records remain in the database

### How to Run Future Cleanups
If users are deleted in the future and orphaned data needs to be cleaned:

1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Run the cleanup script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/cleanupOrphanedData.js
   ```

3. For a dry run (preview only, no deletions):
   ```bash
   node scripts/cleanupOrphanedData.js --dry-run
   ```

### Important Notes
- The script connects to MongoDB Atlas using the [[memory:3196676]] database configured in the `.env` file
- The script maintains referential integrity by cleaning up all related records when orphaned data is found
- Always backup your database before running cleanup operations in production
